The internet's most ruthlessly accurate coverage of Silicon Valley's greatest performance art: venture capital.

Pointless.Ventures is the 99% AI-powered news platform that delivers surgical precision mockery of the startup ecosystem's most spectacular failures, questionable pivots, and valuation gymnastics.



## What We Cover:
- Funding Theater: Series D rounds for companies that pivoted 47 times and still sell "solutions looking for problems"
- Acquisition Comedy: $2B purchases of apps with negative revenue and a waitlist as their only asset
- Unicorn Autopsies: How companies worth more than small nations somehow forgot to build actual products
- VC Bingo: Tracking buzzword density in investment announcements ("AI-powered blockchain solutions for the metaverse")

*Mission Statement: To document the venture capital industrial complex with the reverence it deserves: absolutely none.*
